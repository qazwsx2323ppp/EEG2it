# ~15-minute sanity config for ds003825 with a shorter RSVP window.
#
# Why: RSVP is ~10Hz (new stimulus every 100ms). Using tmax=1.0s means each epoch
# contains responses to many subsequent stimuli -> strong label noise for single-trial supervision.
# This config shortens the window to reduce contamination and quickly test learnability.
#
# Use (server):
#   1) Build cache (new cache filenames because tmax differs):
#        PYTHONPATH=. python utils/build_ds003825_cache.py --config-name ds003825_quick15m_shortwin
#   2) Train:
#        torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=1 main_ds.py --config-name ds003825_quick15m_shortwin

defaults:
  - ds003825_quick15m
  - _self_

data:
  # Shorter post-onset window to reduce RSVP overlap.
  tmax: 0.5

training:
  # Keep epochs short (you can increase once metrics move above chance).
  max_steps_per_epoch: 300
  max_val_steps: 150
