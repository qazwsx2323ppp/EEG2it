# ~15-minute config to test "is it a cross-subject generalization issue?"
# Split is done by trials across the same subject pool, so domain shift is smaller than subject-split.
#
# Use:
#   torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 main_ds.py --config-name ds003825_quick15m_trial

defaults:
  - ds003825_quick15m
