# Trial-split + shorter window variant of ds003825 quick sanity runs.
#
# Goal: distinguish "pipeline can learn within subject" from "cross-subject generalization fails",
# while also reducing RSVP overlap noise via tmax=0.5s.
#
# Use (server):
#   1) Build cache:
#        PYTHONPATH=. python utils/build_ds003825_cache.py --config-name ds003825_quick15m_trial_shortwin
#   2) Train:
#        torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=1 main_ds.py --config-name ds003825_quick15m_trial_shortwin
